Have Built this tiny shrimp‑counter using YOLOv8 👀

Collected and labeled a small custom dataset.

Trained a YOLOv8n detection model with heavy image augmentation and tuned confidence.

Added a Python script to number each shrimp on the image and print the total count automatically.

A simple project, but it was fun taking it from raw photos to a Working Model that can count objects on its own..
